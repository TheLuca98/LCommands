LCommands is a plugin for Bukkit-powered servers that provides several general-purpose commands for the convenience of
Minecraft server administrators and users, without adding the unnecessary bloat that often comes with similar plugins,
such as Essentials. It requires zero configuration and is suitable for any kind of server, from small survival worlds to
massive minigame networks.

**The project is currently under heavy development. Downloads will be available later.**
